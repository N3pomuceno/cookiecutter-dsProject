# TODO

Possible future plans for this project:

- [x] Update to poetry 2.0.1  

- [ ] Add a way to create a repository directly, which will probably require some pre-configured key on the machine. However, I believe it is feasible to link directly with GitHub/GitLab.  

- [ ] Increase the number of libraries, maybe reconsider the *ML_ALL* combination to allow for more library options.  

- [ ] Expand the number of databases we can work with in dbt, as well as in the Dockerfile. Check what we can modify to make this change more practical.
